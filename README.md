# Sales and Returns Analysis_Power BI
## I/ Introducion
### 1. Project Overview
This Power BI project for **Global Superstore Sales**, a multinational retail company, provides key insights into company performance to help guide strategic decisions. The dashboard is built on data from three main tables:

- **Orders**: Contains details for each transaction, like order dates, product info, sales, and profit.
- **People**: Includes information on sales representatives in different regions.
- **Returns**: Tracks returned transactions with product and region details.

### 2. Business Objective
The main goal of this dashboard is to help **Senior Sales Managers** at Global Superstore Sales make smart, data-driven decisions about market expansion and which products to focus on. The dashboard brings together data on sales, profits, and return rates across different regions and product categories, giving a clear picture of how the company is performing.

Senior Sales Managers can use this dashboard to understand how well the company is selling, spot promising markets, and find the best products for growth. By looking at key numbers like revenue, profit, net profit margin, and return rates, managers can see whatâ€™s working well and what needs attention. The dashboard also shows trends in returns, helping to find any product or regional issues that might be causing returns.

Before strategy meetings, managers can quickly check data on how different regions and products are doing, review return rates, and identify any supply chain or customer service issues that could impact business. This data-driven view helps managers create more effective growth strategies based on solid numbers and performance insights.

## III/ Insights and Recommendations
- In general, net profit margin of this year(2014) is relatively low comparing to the same period of last year(2013) ( from 1-2%)
- While the net profit margin of Home Office Customers are high(11.71%), they only contribute 20.8% to the company success profit -> need to raise the consumption of this group
- Table is the product line that has negative net profit margin(-12.3%), although it contribute to the revenue but the profit is negative -> stop this product line or figure out what are the cost led to negative profit( operating cost, depreciation cost,...)
- Paper is the product line with significant NPM(26.29%- more than twice the average NPM) -> invest in marketing, attract more purchase for this product line, choose this as the strategic product
- Try to increase the NPM by reducing COGS (find new supplier, do backward integration,..)
- Focus on the Consumer group as the Target Customer Segment, tailor the products and or buying policies for the group
- Some new Quantity Discount policies to attract more Corporate and Home Office consumers, also to avoid the Returns of large Cart Value Orders
- Investigate the reasons behind the high return rate from APAC and North Asia, develop some policies to restrain Returns in such areas
